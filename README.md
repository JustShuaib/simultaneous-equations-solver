# simulatenous-equations-solver

The purpose of this code is to be able to solve a simultaneous linear equation using either substitution or elimination method.

Current implementation:
1. Elimination method for equations with same coefficients on same type of variables and with either same or different signs

To come:
2. Substitution method for equations that doesn't pass the elimination method requirements
